# jupyter-chat

Jupyter-chat will help you to easily include a chat in a jupyter based application.

This documentation includes several projects all together:

- `@jupyter/chat`, a front-end package (typescript), including all the components
required to build a chat. This package is designed to be used by an extension.

- `jupyterlab-collaborative-chat`, an extension built on top of `@jupyter/chat`, using
the collaborative edition as a messaging system.

- `jupyterlab-ws-chat`, an other extension built on top of `@jupyter/chat`, using
websocket as a messaging system.
