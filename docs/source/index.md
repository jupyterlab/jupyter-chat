# jupyter-chat

Jupyter-chat allows you to easily include a chat in a jupyter based application.

This documentation includes several projects all together:

- `@jupyter/chat`, a front-end package (typescript), including all the components
  required to build a chat. This package is designed to be used in an extension.

- `jupyterlab-chat`, an extension built on top of `@jupyter/chat`, using
  the collaborative edition as messaging system.
